## Overview

Some applications require multiple SSL certificates to function (for example if they serve multiple domains). To configure HAproxy as a termination point for multiple certificates, follow the steps below. Remember to replace placeholder (e.g. `websitename`) with your own values.

This guide assumes you are familiar with Cloud 66 Toolbelt. If you aren't we have a [quick guide](/:product/:version?/toolbelt/using-cloud66-toolbelt) to get you up and running.

### 1. Concatenate the certificate files

Run the following command on your local machine:

```shell
cat CERT1.CRT_PATH [CERT1_MID.crt_path] PRIVATE1.key_PATH > websitename1.pem

cat CERT2.CRT_PATH [CERT2_MID.crt_PATH] PRIVATE2.key_PATH > websitename2.pem
```

### 2. Upload them to /tmp on the server

```shell
cx upload -s app_name --server haproxy_server_name websitename1.pem_PATH websitename1.pem
cx upload -s app_name --server haproxy_server_name websitename2.pem_PATH websitename2.pem
```

### 3. Log into your HAproxy server

```shell
cx ssh -s app_name haproxy_server_name
```

### 4. Copy the cert files from /tmp to their directory

```shell
sudo cp /tmp/websitename1.pem /etc/ssl/private/websitename1.pem
sudo cp /tmp/websitename2.pem /etc/ssl/private/websitename2.pem
```

### 5. Change the settings in your HAproxy config

In the UI Find the following line in your HAproxy config page:

`bind 0.0.0.0:{{port[0]}} ssl crt` 

and change it to:

`bind 0.0.0.0:{{port[0]}} ssl crt websitename1.pem crt websitename2.pem`

<Callout type="warning" title="Filenames must match">
Make sure `websitename1.pem` and `websitename2.pem` are the same name as the filenames you have under `/etc/ssl/private/`
</Callout>
