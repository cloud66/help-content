DNSimple requires an **API token** in order to grant access to DNS management. You can generate them using their web interface:

1. Log into your [DNSimple account](https://dnsimple.com/user)
2. Navigate to the [account access token page](https://www.notion.so/New-SSL-doc-15839e65f0174a3aa6d32d8416aa08f7)
3. Generate a new token
4. Copy the token and keep it somewhere safe

You can now add DNSimple to your Cloud 66 account using these credentials ([see above](#set-up-a-dns-provider)).
