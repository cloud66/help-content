1. Click on your account dropdown (top right) and select API
2. Enable API access (if it’s not enabled already)
3. Update the Access Control list to allow access from “Any IPv4” and “Any IPv6”. If you prefer to restrict access, you will need to add each of Cloud 66’s [authorized IP addresses](https://app.cloud66.com/authorized_ips) individually.
4. Copy your new Vultr API key 

You will use this key to add Vultr as a Deployment Target (see below).
