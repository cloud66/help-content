You can automatically provision and deploy to [Latitude.sh](https://www.latitude.sh/) bare metal servers in any supported location via Cloud 66. You need to add create a Latitude.sh API key in order to connect it to Cloud 66:

1. Log into your Latitude.sh dashboard
2. Click on *API* in the left-hand navigation
3. Click the *Create Key* button (top right) and give your token a name (e.g. Cloud 66)
4. Copy the API token

You will use this token to add Latitude.sh as a Deployment Target (see below).

{% /callout %}

{% callout type="info" title="Custom disk sizes aren’t supported" %}
Latitude.sh does not allow custom disk sizes for new instances. As such any disk size specified in your configuration files or via the Dashboard will be ignored by Latitude.sh.
