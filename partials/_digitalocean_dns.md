DigitalOcean requires an **API token** in order to grant access to DNS management. You can generate them using their web interface:

1. Log into your DigitalOcean account
2. Navigate to [Applications & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)
3. Click *Generate New Token* 
4. Ensure the token has both read and write permissions
5. Copy the token and keep it somewhere safe

You can now add DigitalOcean to your Cloud 66 account using these credentials ([see above](#set-up-a-dns-provider)).
