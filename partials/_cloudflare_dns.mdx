Cloudflare requires an **API token** an **API Key** and the **email address** associated with your Cloudflare account in order to grant access to DNS management. You can generate a **token** using the Cloudflare web interface, and your **key** is listed on the same page:

1. Log into your Cloudflare account 
2. Navigate to My Profile â†’ [API tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)
3. Create a token with permissions over the required DNS zones (you can use the template they provide) - make sure you set the DNS permissions to `Edit` - and copy the resulting token
4. View your Global API key (in the panel below your API tokens) and copy it 
5. Store both your API token and your API key somewhere safe

You can now add Cloudflare to your Cloud 66 account using these credentials ([see above](#set-up-a-dns-provider)).
