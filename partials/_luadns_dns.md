LuaDNS requires an **API key** and an associated **email address** in order to grant access to DNS management. You can generate the key and associate it with an email using their web interface. 

1. Log into your luaDNS account
2. Navigate to the [account settings](https://api.luadns.com/settings) interface
3. Create an [API key](http://www.luadns.com/api.html) associated with an appropriate email address
4. Copy the API key and keep it somewhere safe

You can now add luaDNS to your Cloud 66 account using these credentials ([see above](#set-up-a-dns-provider)).
