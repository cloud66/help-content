Linode requires an **API key** in order to grant access to DNS management. You can generate one using their web interface. 

1. Log into your Linode account
2. Navigate to the [API tokens](https://cloud.linode.com/profile/tokens) interface
3. Create an [API key](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/#personal-access-token)
4. Copy the key and keep it somewhere safe

You can now add Linode to your Cloud 66 account using this key ([see above](#set-up-a-dns-provider)).
