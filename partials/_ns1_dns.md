NS1 requires an **API key** in order to grant access to DNS management. You can generate one using their web interface. 

1. Log into your NS1 account
2. Navigate to [account settings](https://my.nsone.net/#/account/settings) 
3. [Create an API key](https://help.ns1.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017341694-Managing-API-keys) with DNS management privileges
4. Copy the API key and keep it somewhere safe

You can now add NS1 to your Cloud 66 account using this API key ([see above](#set-up-a-dns-provider)).
