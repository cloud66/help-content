<Tab label="Github app">
The easiest option is to give us (read-only) access to a Github repo. To do this:

1. Click *Get Started*
2. On the next page click *Link with Github*
3. We’ll send you to our app on Github (you’ll need to sign in)
4. Once you’re signed in, click *Configure* & then select the Github account you wish to link to Cloud 66
5. Install and authorize our Github app (you can restrict our access to specific repos if needed)
6. You will be redirected back to your Cloud 66 dashboard and you can move on to Step 2.

If you’d prefer to use another git host, or your own self-hosted repository:

1. Click *Get Started*
2. Click the small *I’d rather enter a git repo URL* link
3. Copy the SSH key
4. Open your repo and add the key to the settings (usually found under *SSH* or *SSH keys*)
5. Come back to Cloud 66 and click the green *Next…* button

<Tab label="Using a prebuilt image">
If you already have your code built into images and stored in a registry:

1. Click *Get Started*
2. Click *I’m deploying Docker images*
    - If you’re using the Docker public image repo, enter the name of the Docker image (be sure to spell it correctly)
    - If you’re using a private image repo, click the *Add your credentials* link, choose your provider and your credentials, then click Save and enter the full image name (including the repository) in the form.
