You can automatically provision and deploy to OVHcloud servers in any supported location via Cloud 66. We use Project IDs to access to your cloud resources on OVHcloud. To enable Cloud 66 to manage your servers you need to:

1. Create a new Project using your [OVHcloud dashboard](https://ovh.com/manager/) (or open an existing one)
2. Open the Project and click on *Private Network* (in the left nav) and then *Create a vRack*
3. Choose *New vRack* and then click *Create (*wait for the vRack to be set up before moving on).
4. Copy the Project ID (at the top left, just below your project’s name
5. You will use this token to add OVH as a Deployment Target (see below). 
6. After you paste in your Project ID and click *Add Cloud*.
you will be taken to a sign-in page on the OVH site where you can confirm the required permissions and then log in to authenticate Cloud 66’s access to your Project.
