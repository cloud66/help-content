SakuraCloud requires an **API Token** and **API Secret** which can be obtained from their web interface:

1. Log into your SakuraCloud account
2. Navigate to the [API key](https://secure.sakura.ad.jp/cloud/#!/apikey/top/) interface
3. [Create a key](https://manual.sakura.ad.jp/cloud/en/api/apikey.html) with the required DNS permissions
4. Copy the API key and API secret and keep them somewhere safe

You can now add SakuraCloud to your Cloud 66 account using these credentials ([see above](#set-up-a-dns-provider)).
