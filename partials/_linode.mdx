You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers in any [Linode region](https://developers.cloud66.com/#linode-2). Private networking is automatically enabled for all servers deployed by Cloud 66. This means that servers can communicate freely between each other on the same network without counting towards bandwidth costs.

You need to generate a personal access token for your Linode account to grant Cloud 66 access. To do this:

1. Log into [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/)
2. Click on your username at the top of the screen and select *My Profile*.
3. Click *API Tokens* and then *Add a Personal Access Token*
4. Give the token a label and set its expiry to `Never`
5. Set the access rights for the token to a minimum of:`Account: Read-onlyDomains: Read/WriteKubernetes: Read/WriteLinodes: Read/WriteNodeBalancers: Read/WriteVolumes: Read/Write`
6. Click *Create Token* and then copy the personal access token.

You will use this token to add Linode as a Deployment Target (see below).
