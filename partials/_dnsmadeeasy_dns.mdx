DnsMadeEasy requires an **API key** and **Secret Key** in order to grant access to DNS management. You can generate them using their web interface: 

1. Log into your [DnsMadeEasy account](https://cp.dnsmadeeasy.com/account/info)
2. Navigate to [Config â†’ Account Information](https://support.dnsmadeeasy.com/support/solutions/articles/47001131906-finding-or-generating-api-keys-in-dns-made-easy)
3. Follow instructions on the page to generate API credentials 
4. Copy these keys and keep them somewhere safe

You can now add DnsMadeEasy to your Cloud 66 account using these credentials ([see above](#set-up-a-dns-provider)).
