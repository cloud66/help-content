Cloud 66 supports DigitalOcean API v2, which uses OAuth to authenticate requests. If you choose Digital Ocean as a deployment target (see below) you'll be redirected to the DigitalOcean Ocean site, where you need to **authenticate and approve Cloud 66**. Once confirmed you will be redirected back to Cloud 66, where you can deploy your application to your DigitalOcean account.

You can use Cloud 66 to provision and deploy your code to servers (droplets) in any [DigitalOcean region](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/platform/availability-matrix/).

Private networking is enabled for all data centers that support it. This means that servers can communicate freely between each other on the same network without counting towards bandwidth costs.
