title: Adding memcached
---

[Memcached](https://memcached.org/) is an open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, and it's easy to add to your application via the Cloud 66 Dashboard.

{% callout type="warning" title="" %}
Cloud 66's Memcached component is designed for use with Rails and CSV1 (container stack, V1) applications. Newer containerized applications should implement [Memcached as a service](https://community.cloud66.com/t/how-do-i-add-memcached-to-my-application/54)
{% /callout %}

## Add Memcached

To add Memcached to your application:

1. Open your **application** from the [Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/dashboard).
2. Click on *Data Sources* in the left-hand nav and then *Add Source* in the sub-nav
3. Click the green *+ Add Data Source* button and select *memcached*
4. A drawer will open from the left, with configuration options 
5. Click *Add Server* to start the process

You can now watch the logs, as usual to see the progress of the process.

## Customize Memcached
To customize Memcached, use the below syntax in your [manifest file](/docs/manifest/building-a-manifest-file) and redeploy the application with `Apply security upgrades` option.

```shell
production:
    memcached:
        shared_group: db
        configuration:
            memory: 1024
            port: 11215
            listen_ip: 127.0.0.1
```

{% per-framework includes=["django", "expressjs", "nextjs", "node", "laravel"] %}

{% callout type="warning" title="Added to host, not container" %}
For containerized applications Memcached will be added to the host, not as a container.
{% /callout %}
{% /per-framework %}

## Check Memcached

You can find the details about Memcached under *Settings* in the left-hand nav. Since having Memcached as a separate server will not improve performance, Cloud 66 will install it on each web server, not as a standalone server.
