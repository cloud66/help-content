## What is a custom server?

Adding a custom server to your application allows you to manage your own servers while still benefiting from the Cloud 66 ecosystem.

## Add a custom server

To add a custom server:

1. Open your **application** from the [Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/dashboard).
2. Click on *Data Sources* in the left-hand nav and then *Add Source* in the sub-nav
3. Click the green *+ Add Data Source* button and select *Custom Server*
4. A drawer will open from the left, with configuration options for the server.
5. Click *Add Server* to start the process

You can now watch the logs, as usual to see the progress of the process. Once your server is added, you'll be able to see and manage it as part of your application.
