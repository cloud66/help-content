title: Enabling Slack notifications

---

## Overview

You can choose to receive notifications from your Cloud 66 account in your team's Slack workspace. To set up Slack notifications you need to connect Cloud 66 to your Slack account using the [Cloud 66 Slack App](https://slack.com/apps/AMJ4WVAP4-cloud-66-v2?tab=more_info) which we have created in partnership with Slack. The app is hosted (and approved) by Slack.

## What does the Cloud 66 Slack App do?

The Cloud 66 Slack App does two things:

- It allows Cloud 66 to securely connect to your Slack workspace (with your permission)
- It allows Cloud 66 to push notifications to the Slack channel(s) you define in your Cloud 66 account settings

## Installing the Cloud 66 Slack App

The simplest way to add the app to your Slack account is via your application settings:

1. Log into your [Cloud 66 Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/) 
2. Open the application for which you want Slack notifications
3. Click ⚙️ *Settings* in the left-hand nav
4. Click the *Notifications* tab at the top of the main panel
5. Click on the Slack icon next to any notification type
6. A pop-up will appear that will allow you to start the linking process (you will need to sign into Slack on the same browser)
7. Grant the Cloud 66 application the required permissions on Slack, and set the channel in which you wish to receive the notifications
8. You will be redirected back to your Notifications page where you can enable (or disable) notifications as required.

If you have multiple Slack workspaces, be careful to add the Cloud 66 app to the correct workspace.

### Enabling Slack for account-level notification

You can also enable Slack for your Cloud 66 account notifications. The process is very similar to the one above:

1. Log into your Cloud 66 Dashboard and open the [Notification settings](https://app.cloud66.com/alerts) page (under Account Settings)
2. Click on the Slack icon next to any notification type
3. A pop-up will appear that will allow you to start the linking process (you will need to sign into Slack on the same browser)
4. Grant the Cloud 66 application the required permissions on Slack, and set the channel in which you wish to receive the notifications
5. You will be redirected back to your Notifications page where you can enable (or disable) notifications as required.

## Removing the Cloud 66 Slack App

If you need to remove the Cloud 66 App from your Slack account:

- Log into your workspace
- Click **Menu** and then **Settings & Administration**
- Under Administration click **Manage Apps**
- Click on the name of the app (Cloud 66 V2) - this will open the Cloud 66 app's page in the Slack app directory
- Click on the **Configuration** tab at the top of the main panel
- Click the **Remove App** button

If you have set up multiple configurations enabled under the App, you will need to deactivate and/or remove them one by one.
