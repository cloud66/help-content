title: Writing and debugging Copper rules
lead: "How to write validation policies in Copper DSL"
---

Validation policies in Skycap rely on Copper, an open-source tool developed by Cloud 66. It has its own excellent [documentation](https://copper.sh/docs/copper-dsl/) and this should be the starting point for anyone wanting to craft their own validation policies for Skycap.

## Debugging Copper DSL

Writing valid and conformant rules in Copper DSL will usually require some debugging. Rather than using the Skycap web interface to debug, we suggest that you:

1. [Install Copper](https://copper.sh/docs/getting-started/) on your local machine
2. Download the yml file (Stencil) from your application against which you want to test a rule
3. Write your rule in [Copper DSL](https://copper.sh/docs/copper-dsl/) and save it as a `.cop` file
4. Test the rule against your yml file in your terminal using the `$ copper check` function (you can find the syntax [here](https://copper.sh/docs/getting-started/)).

Once you have a rule that works locally, you can add it to Skycap and run it against the Stencil in question by Rendering the Formation. 

If youâ€™re unsure of how to do this, follow  the [validation policies tutorial](/docs/skycap/using-validation-policies) to acquaint yourself with the steps required.
