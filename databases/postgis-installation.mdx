## Installing with Cloud 66

Note that as of PostgreSQL 16 we install PostGIS automatically. The below information applies to older version of PostgreSQL.

Installing through Cloud 66 is as simple as a manifest file entry. Refer to our [Manifest file](/docs/manifest/building-a-manifest-file#manifest-tutorial) documentation for more information.

In order for your manifest file to be picked up, you need a file called **manifest.yml** to be present within a folder named **.cloud66**, which is in turn located in the root of your source code, checked into your repository.

```shell
[source_repo]/.cloud66/manifest.yml
```

For Cloud 66 to install PostGIS, your manifest file should contain the following:

```yaml
production:
    postgresql:
        configuration:
            postgis: true
```

If you would like to specify versions, it should look something like this:

```yaml
production:
    postgresql:
        configuration:
        	version: 9.6
            postgis:
                version: 2.3.1
```

Once your application has been deployed, you can find your PostGIS file in `/etc/postgresql/share/contrib/postgis-2.1/postgis.sql` on your database server.
