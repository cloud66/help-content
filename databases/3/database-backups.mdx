## Overview

Databases on Cloud 66 Deploy v3 can be backed up using managed backups and for the entire database. As backups are cluster level concerns, you can find them in the **Clusters** section of the Dashboard.

### Managed backups

To add backups to a database:

1. Head to the **Clusters** section of the Dashboard.
2. Select the cluster where your database is located.
3. Click on the **Databases** on the left-hand nav.
4. Select the database tab.
5. Click on the **Add Backup** button.
6. Choose the backup frequency and retention period.
7. Click **Save**.

If your database has replication enabled, you can choose to take the backup from the primary or replica of the database.

## Restoring database backups

Restoring backups involves creating a new database from the backup. Here are the steps:

1. Head to the **Clusters** section of the Dashboard.
2. Select the cluster where your database is located.
3. Click on the **Databases** on the left-hand nav.
4. Select the database tab.
5. Click on the **Restore** button.
6. Choose the backup you want to restore.
7. Click **Restore**.
