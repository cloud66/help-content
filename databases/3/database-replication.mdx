## Overview

Database replication involves configuring a master and replica database architecture, whereby the replica is an exact copy of the master at all times. This feature is supported for Postgres. Redis replication is supported via [Sentinel](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/sentinel/).

## How to enable replication for your database

1. Head to **Clusters** section of the dashboard.
2. Select the cluster where your backup database is located.
3. Click on **Databases** on the left sidebar.
3. Select the database from the tab.
4. Click on the **Enable Replication** button.
