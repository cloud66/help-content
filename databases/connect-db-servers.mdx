There are two ways to connect to your databases:

* Accessing the server directly via SSH and then logging in using terminal commands
* Using a desktop database client
</PerProduct>

<PerProduct includes={["deploy"]} includeVersions={['3']}>
    You can connect your databases using any database client.

## Via SSH

You can connect directly into your database server and invoke a database console from there. To do that, please refer to our [SSH guide](/:product/:version?/servers/ssh-to-server) documentation.

You can find your database's usernames and passwords on the database server page. [See below](#finding-database-credentials) for more details on how to find that page.
</PerProduct>

## With a client

To use a database client, you will first need to add a firewall rule to allow traffic from your desktop to your Cloud 66 application. You can [follow our guide](/:product/:version?/security/firewall-rule) on the subject.

Once the firewall is open you can use a database client from your local computer to access the public IP address of the server hosting the database. See the next section for more details.

## Finding database credentials

<PerProduct includes={["deploy"]} excludeVersions={['3']}>
All of your database usernames and passwords as well as its public IP address can be found on the server pages in your Cloud 66 Dashboard. To find the credentials for a database:

1. Log into your [Cloud 66 Dashboard](https://app.cloud66.com/)
2. Click on the name of your application
3. Click *Data Sources* in the left-hand nav
4. Click the name of database group in the sub-nav
5. Click on the name of an individual database server to see all its details
6. You can select the *Show* checkbox to reveal the passwords, or use the clipboard icon to copy them directly.
