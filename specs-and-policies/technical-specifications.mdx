## Supported cloud providers

Cloud 66 currently supports the following cloud providers:

* [Amazon Web Services](/:product/:version?/build-and-config/adding-a-cloud-provider#aws-amazon-web-services)
* [Digital Ocean](/:product/:version?/build-and-config/adding-a-cloud-provider#digital-ocean)
* [Google Compute Engine](/:product/:version?/build-and-config/adding-a-cloud-provider#google-cloud-gce)
* [Hetzner Cloud](/:product/:version?/build-and-config/adding-a-cloud-provider#hetzner-cloud)
* [Latitude.sh](/:product/:version?/build-and-config/adding-a-cloud-provider#latitude-sh)
* [Linode](/:product/:version?/build-and-config/adding-a-cloud-provider#linode)
* [OVHcloud](/:product/:version?/build-and-config/adding-a-cloud-provider#ovh)
* [Microsoft Azure](/:product/:version?/build-and-config/adding-a-cloud-provider#azure)
* [Vultr](/:product/:version?/build-and-config/adding-a-cloud-provider#vultr)

## Supported platforms

Broadly, we support four types of applications:  

1. Ruby applications running on Rails (or variants like Sinatra)
2. Applications (of any kind) running in Docker containers on Kubernetes clusters
3. Prebuilt or "static" websites built in Jekyll, Hugo or Gatsby

The first option is best suited to traditional "monolithic" application types where all of the components run on a common framework. 

The second platform is best suited to containerized applications with a strong service orientation. Since Docker effectively supports virtually every programming language and framework, it is possible to use it to host any type of application. We support end-to-end Docker deployments. You can either let us build your Docker image (with a Dockerfile), or provide your own.

The third platform is specifically designed to build and host [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/)-style preprocessed application on object storage services.

## Component versions

Cloud 66 servers have two types of components with differing policies on versioning.

### 1. Components built via apt-packages

We default the latest stable major version available from the maintainers of that package.

### 2. Components built from source

Cloud 66 maintains an internal list of versions for most components built from source, which is updated periodically after testing.

You are free to **specify an alternative version** for most of these components in your [manifest file](/:product/:version?/manifest/what-is-a-manifest-file).

<ComponentVersion >
</ComponentVersion>

We deploy a custom release of Nginx. [See below](#nginx-release) for details.

We **don't** install a default version of Rails - the version installed is based on the requirements of your application. Versions earlier than 2.6.3 *may* work but have some compatibility issues with recent versions of Ubuntu.

<Callout type="error" title="Using non-default versions">
If you're using different (non-default) versions of components, we strongly recommend testing your application thoroughly in a non-production environment before deploying. 
</Callout>

### Nginx release

Cloud 66 maintains our own self-contained release of Nginx which includes all of the modules listed below. 

The current NGINX version used by our custom release is <ComponentVersion names={["Nginx"]} tabular={false} />.

For more info please read the [Releases page on our Github project](https://github.com/cloud66-oss/nginx-compiler/releases). 

### Nginx modules

We install the Nginx modules listed below by default. These are used to provide additional features and functions to applications managed by Cloud 66.
