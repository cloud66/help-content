title: Cloud 66 product consolidation
---

## Overview

Before December 2022 Cloud 66 had four separate products:

* Cloud 66 for Rails
* Cloud 66 for Node
* Maestro (versions 1 & 2)
* Prepress

All these products existed to serve a single purpose: deployment of any application to any cloud.

Since December 2022 we have consolidated all of our offerings and features into a single unified product called simply "Cloud 66". This product focuses on enabling the deployment of any application framework to any cloud.

## What does this mean for my application?

While this is a huge improvement in onboarding and usability of our products and documentation, all of the great features powering our product have stayed the same.

Existing customers will be largely unaffected by this change apart from some updates to our interfaces. New customers have a simpler and more streamlined experience when deploying applications for the first time.
