title: Cloud 66 Products

## Overview

Cloud 66 products have gone through a few rounds of changes over the years. Our original product was a deployment tool for Ruby on Rails applications.

Over the time we added support for Node.js applications, and then added support for other application frameworks such as PHP, Python, Go, and Java and finally added support for static site generators.

These changes have been reflected in our product names and branding over the years. When you start deploying your code with Cloud 66, our system automatically detects the application framework and chooses the right deployment strategy for you.

However, it might help you to understand the history of our products and their names, so you can better understand our documentation and support articles.
