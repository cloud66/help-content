## What is Cloud 66?

Cloud 66 is a service that automates and streamlines the building, deployment and lifecycle management of web applications. The service supports three types of applications:

* Containerized applications (Docker running on Kubernetes)
* Native Ruby and Node applications (non-containerized)
* Prebuilt (pre-rendered) sites (based on the Jamstack architecture)

Cloud 66 builds the infrastructural components needed to run your application, deploys your application to those components and manages them for you. You can use it to deploy your app to the cloud or your own infrastructure.

## Where is Cloud 66 hosted?

Cloud 66 is hosted in the cloud and is available as a service. You don't need to install, deploy or configure anything to use it.

## How can I use Cloud 66?

[Sign up](https://app.cloud66.com/users/sign_up) for an account and start by building your first application. Specify a Git repository containing your application code, or provide a Docker image. A few seconds later you can configure your deployment and point your application to the infrastructure on which you would like it run.

## Can I use Cloud 66 with my own servers?

Yes! Cloud 66 configures and deploys your code to your servers in the cloud or to your own dedicated servers.

## Why do you need my server SSH key?

Cloud 66 uses remote SSH keys to set up an SSH tunnel to your server and execute remote bash scripts. For additional security we only use remote SSH keys to connect to your server, never username and password access.

## Are their any requirements for the user on my servers?

Yes. As Cloud 66 will be provisioning services on your servers from scratch, the server must meet a number of requirements outlined in the [Registered servers](/:product/:version?/servers/registered-servers) documentation.

## Can I deploy multiple apps on a single server?

Yes - you can have any number of applications running on a single server at any point in time. (Of course this is naturally limited by the amount of load that server can support.)
