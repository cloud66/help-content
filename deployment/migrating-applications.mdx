title: Migrating your application between servers
---

## Step by step guide

1. Set up a [Failover Group](/:product/:version?/failover-groups/failover-groups)
2. Add the IP address of the Failover Group to your DNS record (allow 24 hours to propogate)
3. Set up a [managed backup](/:product/:version?/databases/database-backups) for your database 
4. [Clone your application](/:product/:version?/cloud-66-101/adding-updating-deleting#clone-an-application) to the new server
5. [Add databases](/:product/:version?/databases/adding-database) as required to the clone
6. Set up a [replication](/:product/:version?/databases/database-replication) between to the clone databases
7. Add the cloned application to the failover group as the secondary application
8. Put the primary site into [maintenance mode](/:product/:version?/deployment/using-maintenance-mode)
9. [Promote](/:product/:version?/toolbelt/_databases-promote-replica) the cloned databases to masters
10. Switch the Failover Group to the new application
11. [OPTIONAL] Switch your DNS record to the new application

This method can be used to migrate applications between regions as well.
