Allows direct SSH shell into your servers by opening the firewall temporarily for the source IP address and starting a SSH session with one command.

You need to [add your public (local) SSH key](/docs/servers/ssh-to-server#cloud-66-toolbelt-cli) to your Cloud 66 account before running this command. You also need to have “shell to server” rights on the application to use this command.

<PerFramework includes={["rails"]}>
If your server deployed behind a gateway, you need to provide the private key in order to pass through the gateway.

$ cx ssh  [--gateway-key <path to gateway key>] --stack <application name> <server name>|<server ip>|<server role> --vv [-i <your private key>]
```
