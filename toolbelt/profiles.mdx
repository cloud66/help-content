## Setting up a profile

1. Run `cx config create <name>` where `<name>` is your chosen profile name
2. Run `cx config use <name>` to switch to the new profile and initialize it by running  `cx stacks list`
3. Authenticate using your browser (be sure to log into the correct account)

For more detailed help on installation please refer to our [Getting Started](/:product/:version?/toolbelt/using-cloud66-toolbelt) guide.

<Callout type="info" title="Default profile">
    You always have a `default` profile which cannot be deleted or renamed.
</Callout>

## Switching between profiles

To switch between profiles, use `cx config use <name>`

All commands from that point onwards will run against the `<name>` profile. This is persisted between different terminal sessions until it's changed.

### Setting Profile per command

If you would like to run a command with a different profile other than the current profile, you can use the `--profile` argument with all commands:

```shell
cx --profile NAME stacks list
```

### Using profiles with organizations

When you create a profile you can specify the organization to which this new profile should be linked. For example:

```shell
cx config create hobby --org my_private_sandbox
```

...will create a profile named "hobby" that is linked to a Cloud 66 organization named "my_private_sandbox".

If you're unsure about the name of an organization you can run the `cx info` command and looking at the `Name` field. You can also see this by logging into your Dashboard, visiting Account Settings and clicking on Organisations in the Account panel on the left.
