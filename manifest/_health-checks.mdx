## Post-deployment availability checks

You can configure your application to automatically run [global availability checks](/:product/:version?/servers/application-health-checks) against an HTTP endpoint each time it is deployed. Results of these checks are available on your Cloud 66 dashboard under *ActiveProtect*. 

<Callout type="info" title="Positioning Health Check settings">
Note that all of the Health Check settings must be nested under the `configuration` → `activeprotect` → `health_check` sub-node.
</Callout>

The following settings are available via the Manifest file:

|Option|Applied on|Description|Clouds|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`endpoint`|<Glyph icon="redeploy" />|The endpoint to that will be queried during the check|All|
|`accept`|<Glyph icon="redeploy" />|The set of HTTP codes we will accept as valid from the endpoint (as an array)|All|
|`timeout`|<Glyph icon="redeploy" />|The timeout limit in seconds of the endpoint (limit: `10`)|All|
|`max_redirects`|<Glyph icon="redeploy" />|The number of acceptable HTTP redirects (limit: `10`)|All|
|`cooldown`|<Glyph icon="redeploy" />|The delay between the end of the deployment process and the start of the test, in seconds. (limit: `1800`)|All|

### Example YAML for post-deployment global availability checks

<PerProduct includes={["deploy"]}>

```yaml
docker:

        accept: ["200", "300-399"] # Default is 200
        timeout: 2 # Default is 5
        max_redirects: 5 # Default is 3
        cooldown: 120 # Default is 0
