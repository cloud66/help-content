## GlusterFS

[GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) is a scalable network filesystem suitable for data-intensive tasks such as cloud storage and media streaming.

### Restrictions with GlusterFS

- Renaming a volume will actually **delete that volume** and create a new one.
- After you change the volume list, you need to redeploy your application for new configuration be applied to your application.
- You cannot change `replica_count` after GlusterFS added to your application.
- You cannot use `glusterfs group` or any of its servers in `mount_targets`.

The following settings are available via the Manifest file:
