### Example YAML for Linode Nodebalancer

```yaml
load_balancer:
  configuration:
    httpchk: /
    balance: leastconn
    wait_after_adding_servers: 30 # default is 0
    wait_after_removing_servers: 10 # default is 0
```

## Automatic endpoint test

Load balancers periodically check the health of your servers by connecting to a URL endpoint. If the server responds with an HTTP 200 OK status, it is considered healthy. The `httpchk` setting allows you to specify which URL path should be checked.

The default value is `/` (root path) but you can customize it to any valid endpoint in your application that returns a 200 status when healthy.
