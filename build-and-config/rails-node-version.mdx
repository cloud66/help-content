## Controlling the Node version for your Rails application

We automatically install the latest release of Node version <ComponentVersion names={["node"]} tabular={false} />  when we set up your Rack/Rails application servers. You can control which version is installed by editing the [manifest file](/:product/:version?/manifest/building-a-manifest-file) for the Rails application. 

```yaml
rails:
  configuration:
    node_version: "18"       # will install latest v18.x.x
    node_version: "18.1"    # will install latest v18.1.x
```


<Callout type="warning" title="Applying changes">
  To apply changes to the Node version you need to update your manifest file, then [deploy-with-options](/:product/:version?/servers/applying-upgrades#ubuntu) and select the **Apply Ruby/Node upgrades** option.
